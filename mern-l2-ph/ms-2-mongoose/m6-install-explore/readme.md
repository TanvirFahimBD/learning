- **6-1: Introduction to Mongoose**
  - ODM - Object data modeling library of MongoDB.
  - mongoose → mongodb wrapper
  - Give higher level abstraction
  - Schema, model, relationships with MongoDB
  - Have structure or follow mapping
  - Create object & check type, validation
  - object → ODM → mongoose → mongoDb driver → mongodb
  - Features - Schema definition, Model creation, data validation, querying, middleware, `population`
  - Company using - Ebay, Uber, Metlife, pathao
  - Mongoose with TS steps - `Interface → Schema → Model → Database Query`
- **6-2: Install express , typescript, mongoose , ts-node-dev**
  - mongodb community server - create local server. download & install.
  - version check - `mongose --v`
  - GUI view data - compass install
  - connect compass
  - `npm —init` & Install express mongoose
  - `tsc —init` & Install typescript & ts-node-dev as dev dependency on project - `npm i typescript --save-dev` & also `npm i ts-node-dev --save-dev`
  - script dev - `"dev": "ts-node-dev --respawn --transpile-only src/server.ts",`
  - server setup and mongoose connect
- **6-3: How to organize your code alittle more . install and implement types**
  - app listen into mongodb connection
  - Import syntax use from es2015
  - cors install & import & use
  - Divide file & create app.ts. express, app, cors shift into app.ts.
  - Install `npm i —save-dev @types/cors` & `npm i —save-dev @types/express`
  - Export app & use into server
  - Check root route working or not
  - Import type from express & Declare app type Application, req type Request, res type Response, next type NextFunction, port type number
- **6-4: How To relate Interface and schema**
  - parse data by express.json() & express.urlencoded({true})
  - Step - Interface, Schema, Model, Database query
  - Create Interface. type, string, enum, object. Here type start with Lowercase
  - Create Schema following generic Interface & type check, required. Here type start with Uppercase
  - Keep in mind - Developer is responsible for ensuring document interface is line up with mongoose schema. Mongoose won’t report an error if email is required in your mongoose schema.
- **6-5: Create Model using Interface , Schema and Insert Data**
  - Model creation - model<generic>(’Name’, SchemaName)
  - create data instance by following interface with generics
  - use async await call mongoose method then save data into db
  - request method hit - save the data to db will occure
  - keep eye on unique data checking otherwise give error. So to keep data into mongodb database must follow schema.
- **6-6: How to organize your structure , MVC vs Modular**
  - Separate code - MVC pattern vs Modular pattern. Modular more popular nowadays
  - MVC have - model, view, controller, routes, utils, interface. But as seperate all change one is prettry hassel
  - Modulare have - app → modules → role → (interfac, model, route, controller, utils)
  - Separate interface, model, route, db query function from previous code. app from method call will make the app huge so separate by route
- **6-7: More Refactoring, Test api to insert data**
  - Separate service & import model to service
  - Separate route
  - Separate controller. call service from controller. return service response to controller & response contoller
  - app.use() from call specific route
- **6-8: Create and Test Post Route , Refactor Code**
  - route → controller → service
  - route, controller, services will be same place for specific modules
  - get data by - .find()
  - post data by - data.save()
  - service return type -Promise<InterfaceName>
- **6-9: Find , FindOne , Field Filtering**
  - findONe - findOne({id: payload}). return type Promise<IUser | null>. controller gets payload = req.params
  - field filtering methodology / get specific field - findOne({id: payload}, {name:1})
- **6-10: What is instance methods ,built custom instance method**
  - create interface, create method
  - change Schema generic type - <Interface, Model, Method>
  - Schema method define
  - Model create on schema & generic type <Interface, Model>
  - create new instance & access instance method
  - static method use by calling directly from class or model
- **6-11: What is statics ,built custom static method**
  - create schema static method & define method actions. this will be async await function
  - interface create & declare static method extending model & schema generic type as use
  - static method now useable
  - service, controller, route make ready
  - dynamic route will be at last of same types of all routes. others wise other route will not work
